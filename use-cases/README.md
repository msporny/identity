Use Case List
==================

Please document use cases for identity on mobile on the web here. 

## Naomi Logs in to Read her Email
Naomi uses a lot of devices to check her email on the web. She is worried that other people may try to access her email so she wants some extra methods of identification. Yuki always has her mobile device with her, so she would like to use an identity provider on her device as a two-factor method to authenticate her to login to read her email on the web on many devices.

## Charlotte's Food Travel Blog
Charlotte runs a Food Travel Blog which allows users to write blog posts about their food experiences when travelling. Charlotte doesn't want to manage large amounts of private data and she wants to offer her users an easy way to login as well as peace-of-mind with regards to the safety of their data. Charlotte would like to use OpenID Connect, and she would like a simple web API to allow users to select their identity provider and login to Charlotte's site to add posts, without Charlotte needing to keep this data herself.
