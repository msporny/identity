Identity Use Cases and Standards Considerations
==================

This repository is setup to document use cases for indentity solutions on web on mobile and document proposed standards associated with identity on the web. This repo was setup in response to the email chain started [29 January 2014](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-mobile/2014Jan/0038.html) and continuing in the [W3C Web and Mobile IG mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-mobile/2014Jan/thread.html).

Drop use cases onto the [Use Cases wiki page](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/identity/wiki/Use-Case-List). Everyone should have access to this page.

If you find you have ideas / suggestions which don't fit in the 'Use Cases' wiki page but you feel should be documented then please add them to the [Considerations for Identity Standards Work page](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/identity/wiki/Considerations-for-Identity-Standards-Work). Everyone should have access to this page.

When we have collected enough use cases and assessed the considerations, we will hold a discussion on next actions.
